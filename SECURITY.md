# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. Contact the maintainers

Send an email to: **rowan@example.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As soon as possible (typically within 30 days)

### 4. Disclosure process

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and confirm the vulnerability
- We will work on a fix
- We will coordinate disclosure with you
- We will release a security update

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Use environment variables for sensitive data**
   ```bash
   # Never commit API keys to version control
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

3. **Run in isolated environments**
   - Use virtual environments
   - Consider using Docker containers
   - Limit network access when possible

4. **Monitor for updates**
   - Watch the repository for security releases
   - Subscribe to security notifications

### For Developers

1. **Code security**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Dependency management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use tools like `safety` to check for vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions in production

3. **API security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Rate limit API endpoints
   - Validate API keys and tokens

4. **Data protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Input validation**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection

2. **API security**
   - Secure API key storage
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints
   - Input validation for all API calls

3. **Data protection**
   - No sensitive data stored in logs
   - Secure configuration management
   - Environment variable protection

4. **Network security**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Secure communication protocols
   - Network isolation options

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 authentication
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] Advanced rate limiting
- [ ] Security headers implementation
- [ ] Automated security scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing integration

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Public Disclosure

When we release a security update, we will:

1. Publish a security advisory
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md
3. Tag the release with security information
4. Notify users through appropriate channels

### Credit

We will credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Tools

### Recommended Tools

1. **Dependency scanning**
   ```bash
   pip install safety
   safety check
   ```

2. **Code analysis**
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   bandit -r .
   ```

3. **Security testing**
   ```bash
   pip install pytest-security
   pytest --security
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- Automated dependency scanning
- Security linting
- Vulnerability checks
- Code quality analysis

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor logs and metrics
   - Automated security alerts
   - User reports

2. **Assessment**
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Classify severity level
   - Document findings

3. **Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Prevent further damage

4. **Eradication**
   - Remove root cause
   - Apply permanent fixes
   - Verify resolution

5. **Recovery**
   - Restore normal operations
   - Monitor for recurrence
   - Update security measures

6. **Lessons Learned**
   - Post-incident review
   - Update procedures
   - Improve security posture

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: rowan@example.com
- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for initial response

## Acknowledgments

We thank the security community for their responsible disclosure practices and contributions to improving the security of this project.
